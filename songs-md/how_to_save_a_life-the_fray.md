<G>                    <D/F#>
Step one you say we need to talk
    <Em7>              <D/F#>             <G>
He walks you say sit down it’s just a talk
             <D/F#>           <Em7>
He smiles politely back at you
             <D/F#>             <G>
You stare politely right on through
               <D/F#>          <Em7>
Some sort of window to your right
             <D/F#>             <G>
As he goes left and you stay right
              <D/F#>             <Em7>
Between the lines of fear and blame
                  <D/F#>
And you begin to wonder why you came

<C>               <D>                <Em>
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            <G>             <D/F#>
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    <C>                   <D>                <Em>
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             <G>*    <D/F#>*
Had I known how to save a life
 
<G>   <D/F#>   <Em7>   <D/F#>

<G>                 <D/F#>
Let him know that you know best
       <Em7>          <D/F#>
Cause after all you do know best
<G>                  <D/F#>
  Try to slip past his defense
<Em7>              <D/F#>
Without granting innocence
<G>             <D/F#>             <Em7>
   Lay down a list of what is wrong
             <D/F#>
The things you’ve told him all along
<G>              <D/F#>
Pray to God he hears you
      <Em7>            <D/F#>
And I pray to God he hears you
    <C>               <D>                <Em>
And where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            <G>             <D/F#>
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    <C>                   <D>                <Em>
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             <G>     <D/F#>    <G>
Had I known how to save a life
 
<G>   <D/F#>   <Em7>   <D/F#>

    <G>            <D/F#>
As he begins to raise his voice
    <Em7>             <D/F#>                 <G>
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
                 <D/F#>
Drive until you lose the road
    <Em7>                        <D/F#>
Or break with the ones you’ve followed
<G>             <D/F#>
   He will do one of two things
<Em7>              <D/F#>
He will admit to everything
<G>                      <D/F#>
Or he’ll say he’s just not the same
     <Em7>            <D/F#>
And you’ll begin to wonder why you came
 
<C>               <D>                <Em>
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            <G>             <D/F#>
